# React Docker Laravel contact form

A React Docker Laravel sample code

## Getting started

You can make any changes to what is provided that you see fit. This entire repo is intended as a convenience. You are not *required* to use it.

## Add your files
The `./API` folder is where you will write the **server** portion of the code test. `./UI` will store the **React** portion.

## Run with Docker
To run your project, simply run `docker-compose up` in your terminal. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

The `Dockerfile`s are already configured to handle all the Apache server work. You just need to provide the PHP code.

The API docker container is configured to listen on port `8000`. The UI container uses `3000`.

## Replace this file
It's a good idea to replace this file with your own `README.md` describing anything we might need to know about running your app.

## Support
There's nothing wrong with asking for help. If you need any clarification on how to use this repo or the test details themselves, please reach out to us for assistance.
